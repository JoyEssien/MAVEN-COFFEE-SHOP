### PROJECT OVERVIEW

 I'm thrilled to showcase this project, focusing on the Maven Roaster coffee shop, which operates three bustling locations in New York City. This project was a deep dive into understanding customer purchase behavior and optimizing operational efficiency from data collected between January and June 2023, during peak hours from 7 AM to 8 PM.

Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished and the key insights gained:

### DATA SOURCE

- MAVEN ANALYTICS : "Coffee Shop Sales.xlsx"

### TOOLS

- MICROSOFT EXCEL: Data Cleaning
- MICROSOFT EXCEL: Data Visualization/Create a Report

### DATA CLEANING/PREPARATIONS


 - Data Cleaning:
    - Removed duplicate entries to prevent skewed results.
    - Handled missing values through imputation for numerical data and mode for categorical data or removed incomplete rows.
    - Corrected inconsistencies in date and time formats, product names, and categories.
 - Data Transformation:
    - Created new columns to categorize purchase times into specific intervals (e.g., morning, afternoon).
    - Derived additional metrics like total sales per transaction, average transaction value, and customer frequency.
 - Data Integration: Combined data from various sources (e.g., point-of-sale systems, mobile orders) to create a unified dataset for a comprehensive analysis.
 - Data Filtering: Focused on relevant time periods (7 AM - 8 PM) to ensure the analysis aligned with operational hours.
 - Data Validation: Cross-checked data accuracy by comparing a subset of entries against original records to ensure reliability.

### PROJECT GOAL

To transform the data to a dynamic dashboard that franchise owner can use to patterns, trends, and opportunities for businesses.

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

 In my analysis of Maven Roaster coffee shop data, I utilized pivot charts and slicers to create insightful visualizations and streamline the analysis of various metrics. Here are the steps and key findings from my exploratory data analysis:

  1. Data Summary:
Generated Summary Statistics: Calculated essential metrics such as total sales, average sales per transaction, and customer count.
Categorized Data: Classified data by product type, time of purchase, and store location to facilitate detailed analysis.

  2. Visualization with Pivot Charts:
     - Store Performance Analysis: Created pivot charts to compare sales performance across the three locations.
       Analyzed total sales, average sales per transaction, and customer count for each store.
     - Product Performance Analysis: Used pivot charts to identify best-selling products at each store.
       Evaluated the contribution of different product categories (e.g., beverages, pastries) to overall sales.
  3. Peak Period Analysis: Generated time-based pivot charts to analyze sales trends throughout the day.
     Identified peak sales periods (e.g., morning rush, afternoon breaks) by visualizing sales data for each hour.
  4. Interactive Analysis with Slicers: Dynamic Filtering: Incorporated slicers to enable interactive filtering of data by store location, product type, and time 
     period.
     
Enhanced Insights: Allowed for quick comparison and deeper insights into specific segments of data by using slicers.

### KEY FINDINGS

I observed interesting patterns in transactions by day of the week and hour of the day. For instance, in Lower Manhattan, transactions are lowest around 8-9 PM, suggesting that keeping the store open during this time may result in financial losses. Conversely, the highest sales occur on Monday mornings, with coffee being the most purchased item.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the exploratory data analysis of Maven Roaster coffee shops, several key patterns emerged that can inform strategic decisions to enhance operations and increase profitability. Here are some targeted recommendations:

  1. Optimize Store Hours:
     - Lower Manhattan Location: Given the low transaction volume observed between 8-9 PM, consider closing the store earlier to reduce operational costs and avoid 
       financial losses during this period. Adjusting the closing time to align with customer behavior can lead to significant cost savings.
     - Monday Morning Peak: With the highest sales occurring on Monday mornings, especially for coffee, ensure that the store is fully staffed and well-stocked 
       during this time to capitalize on the increased demand. Consider opening slightly earlier to capture more of the morning rush.
       
  2. Inventory Management:
     - Focus on Best-Selling Items: With coffee being the most purchased item on Monday mornings, prioritize inventory for coffee and related products. Ensure 
       that supplies for popular items like lattes and cold brews are readily available to meet customer demand.
     - Seasonal Offerings: Given the popularity of seasonal items such as the Pumpkin Spice Latte, plan inventory and marketing campaigns around these products to 
       maximize sales during their peak periods.
     
  3. Staff Scheduling:
     - Peak Period Staffing: Increase staff during peak hours, particularly on Monday mornings, to maintain high service quality and minimize wait times. 
       Conversely, reduce staffing during low-transaction periods, such as late evenings in Lower Manhattan, to optimize labor costs.
     - Flexible Scheduling: Implement a flexible staffing model that can adapt to changes in customer traffic patterns. Use historical data to forecast busy 
      periods and adjust schedules accordingly.
     
  4. Promotions and Marketing:
     - Targeted Promotions: Launch promotions targeting the high-sales periods. For example, offer discounts or loyalty points for coffee purchases on Monday 
       mornings to further boost sales.
     - Off-Peak Incentives: To drive traffic during slower periods, such as late evenings, consider offering special promotions or discounts. Alternatively, 
       evaluate the cost-benefit of remaining open during these times and potentially closing earlier.
       
  5. Customer Engagement:
      - Loyalty Programs: Strengthen customer loyalty programs to reward regular customers who contribute significantly to sales. Offer exclusive deals or early 
        access to seasonal products for loyalty members.
      - Feedback Mechanisms: Implement feedback systems to gather customer insights on preferences and service quality. Use this feedback to continually refine 
        offerings and improve the customer experience.
        
Conclusion:
By implementing these recommendations, Maven Roaster can enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and capitalize on high-demand periods. Adjusting store hours, optimizing inventory and staffing, and targeting promotions will help align business operations with customer behavior, ultimately driving increased profitability and customer satisfaction
